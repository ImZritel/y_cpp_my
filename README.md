# Simple search engine

1. Why:
- pet project for C++ STL and multithreading learning

2. What it does:
- store text documents (deleting and checking for duplicates);
- search documents by text query taking into account:
  - stop words (ignored in search process);
  - minus words (if appeared in document, the document excludes from the search results).
- matching query on given document, return words that exist in both query and document.
